## Introduction

This Helm chart installs [Knative Serving Core](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/) and it's CRDs.

## Prerequisites

To use the charts here, [Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be configured for your
Kubernetes cluster. Setting up Kubernetes and Helm is outside the scope of
this README. Please refer to the Kubernetes and Helm documentation.

- **Helm 3.0+** – This chart was tested with Helm v3.6.3, but it is also expected to work with earlier Helm versions
- **Kubernetes 1.22+** – This chart was tested with GKE v1.22.x

## Installation

### Add Helm repository

```shell
$ helm repo add dsp http://artifactory-gojek.golabs.io/artifactory/generic-local/dsp-charts/
```

### Installing the chart

This command will install Knative release named `knative-serving` in the `knative-serving` namespace.
Do not try to install into other namespaces as it will break with other installations like Kserve.
Default chart values will be used for the installation:
```shell
$ helm install dsp/knative-serving-core --namespace knative-serving
```

You can (and most likely, should) override the default configuration with values suitable for your installation.
Refer to [Configuration](#configuration) section for the detailed description of available configuration keys.

### Uninstalling the chart

To uninstall `knative-serving-core` release:
```shell
$ helm uninstall -n knative-serving knative-serving-core
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release,
except for postgresql PVC, those will have to be removed manually.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Knative Serving Core chart and their default values.
